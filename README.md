# Unexpected Input Handling in Ruby Class

This repository demonstrates a potential bug related to type checking and handling of unexpected input in a simple Ruby class.  The `MyClass` is designed to handle numerical values, but lacks type validation, leading to unexpected behavior when a string is assigned.

The `bug.rb` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.rb` shows how to improve the class to handle type checking and prevent this issue.
